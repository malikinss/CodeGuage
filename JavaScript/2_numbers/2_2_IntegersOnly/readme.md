# Valid Integer Input Program

## Description 📝
This JavaScript program prompts the user to enter a valid integer. It continuously validates the input until a valid integer is provided, using alerts to inform the user of any invalid entries.

## Purpose 🎯
The purpose of this program is to ensure that the user inputs a valid integer, preventing potential errors in further calculations or operations that require integer values.

## How It Works 🔍
1. The program prompts the user to enter an integer.
2. It checks if the input is a valid integer using `Number()` and `parseInt()`.
3. If the input is invalid, an alert is shown, and the user is prompted again.
4. This process repeats until a valid integer is entered.
5. Once a valid integer is obtained, it is displayed on the document.

## Output 📜
- Displays the valid integer entered by the user.

## Usage 📦
1. Run the program in a browser environment.
2. When prompted, enter an integer.
   ```javascript
   // Example inputs:
   // Valid: 50, -10, 0
   // Invalid: 'Hi', '10x', '10.1', '', 'Infinity'

## Conclusion 🚀
This program effectively handles user input, ensuring that only valid integers are accepted, enhancing user experience and preventing errors in data processing.
